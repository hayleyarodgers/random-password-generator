# random-password-generator

## Description

My goal for this project was to create a random password generator. This application gives the user the ability to create an 8-128 character password made of a random combination of their choice of lower case, upper case, numerical and special characters. This is important for creating strong passwords and increasing internet security.

To achieve this, I used Javascript.

During this project, I consolidated my understanding of Javascript. In particular, I re-inforced what I have learnt about:
- Variables
- Arrays
- Operators
- Conditional statements
- And, for loops.

In the future, I would like to re-visit this project and explore how I could use CSS to improve the user experience. In particular, I would like the user to select their password preferences directly on the screen instead of via prompts.
